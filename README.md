# **Stock Options Analysis Tool**

This Python script provides a comprehensive analysis of stock options using data retrieved from Yahoo Finance. It calculates various metrics such as implied volatility, historical volatility, intrinsic value, and time value for stock options. The analysis is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and historical stock price data.
